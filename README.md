# Vagrant Ansible Citadel

This project contains a Vagrant based development environment using Ansible. As
someone who works in all kinds of different development environments, I hate
when the collide with other projects I might be working on... Here's looking at
you Ruby!

This got me into the practice of creating development environments in VMs and
never allowing myself to install them on my MacBook. Less pollution, less
conflict. Well, when I decided to give Ansible a spin, I decided I wanted to be
able to do the same thing. So, I created this template that I use for any
infrastructure project I need to maintain. I use it as a seed project for every
project / infrastructure that I need to maintain, and then grow it from there.

This project should work successfully on any Linux, Mac or Windows environment
capable of running Vagrant and VirtualBox.

By default, this environment installs the AWS CLI and Boto. If you would like to
change/update/edit what is installed by default as your base environment, you
can either fork/clone the project and edit
`ansible/localhost/base/tasks/main.yml`. Or, you can use one of the Boxes in
your Vagrantfile and then expand upon it (which is the intention).

## Usage
The output of this project is a collection of Vagrant Boxes. To use one of the
Boxes for one of your projects, simply add the following to your Vagrantfile.

```bash
  # Use Ansible Citadel based on ubuntu/trusty64
  config.vm.box = "oakensoul/ansible-citadel-trusty64"

  # Use Ansible Citadel based on hashicorp/precise64
  config.vm.box = "oakensoul/ansible-citadel-precise64"
```

## Contributing
### Contributing Guidelines
If you would like to contribute to this project, please read the
[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.

### Dependencies

To use this development environment, you must have Vagrant and VirtualBox
installed.

We also recommend using the vagrant plugin "vagrant-vbguest" to prevent the
VirtualBox guest additions from getting out of sync.

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

### Vagrant

Once you have the repository cloned, you need only spin up your Vagrant
environment. If you need information about how to use Vagrant, please see the
http://vagrantup.com website. For this documentation, we'll assume you have at
least entry level Vagrant knowledge. If you don't, feel free to use the Issues
section of the repository to ask questions.

In order to get Ansible installed inside the Guest VM, you will notice inside
the Vagrantfile a section using the shell provisioner. In case you're curious,
we've used this approach to install Ansible as provided by
[Rob Allen](https://github.com/akrabat) in his
[blog post](http://akrabat.com/computing/provisioning-with-ansible-within-the-vagrant-guest/)
about such things.

As he mentions, the reason for this is that we don't want to rely on the Host
machine to have Ansible installed, that dirties up your machine with even more
stuff to maintain... and it doesn't follow the Infrastructure as Code
requirement of our team!

One thing to note, your project directory is mapped inside the Guest VM in the
folder `/vagrant`.

## Automation and Development

Now that you've got your development environment, simply ssh into the Guest VM
and off you go. To customize your dev environment use the included Ansible
playbooks, or add new sub modules under the ansible/playbooks folder. If you've
never used Ansible, we would recommend you pause and run through some internet
learning on Ansible.

### Create your inventory files

You can either create a basic inventory file, or you can use one of the dynamic
inventory scripts created by the folks at Ansible.
- [Example EC2 External Inventory Script](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#example-aws-ec2-external-inventory-script)
- [Ansible Inventory Plugins](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/plugins/inventory)

### Playbooks

You should create or clone your submodule playbooks into an `ansible/playbooks`
folder to keep everything stored together.

### EC2 Provisioning

If you are using EC2 you will likely need to provision an instance. If you are
using a datacenter environment, likely the machine has already been provisioned.
It is worth mentioning, this project really doesn't support multiple developers
currently, that is something that will need to be fixed once it works enough to
get the project going.

#### Configure AWS CLI
```bash
$ aws configure
```

You will probably want to set your default region to `us-east-1` and your
default output format to `json`.

#### MFA Token
If your account requires the use of an MFA token, you will need to create a
token using the Amazon Simple Token Service (STS). Once you've created the token
you will need to place the values it returns into environment variables.

The command below asks for your MFA serial number, which can be found on your
uses IAM details, and is usually represented by an
`arn:aws:iam:bunchofnumbers:mfa/username`

The mfa token code is generated by your iphone app, or fob, whatever you're
using.

```bash
$ aws sts get-session-token --serial-number {serial number here} --token-code {mfa token here}
```

You will receive output that looks something like the following:
```bash
{
    "Credentials": {
        "SecretAccessKey": "IwK1V7ASDFADSFADFASDFASDFadsfasdfasdfadsfasdfasdf45gsdfg",
        "SessionToken": "AQoDYXdzEGsagALvxo+QSQkIk3qQuJ9SPIs4A/hi+qZJeQBEb4h545yhb45hb45yb45yb4hy54CB8IqUyIyS8r6I4Y/Nu+EoO4Q22GJbumCu1QGE2islfkgjlkKJTSfdgj5lkjW+5aYF",
        "Expiration": "2015-02-10T13:30:45Z",
        "AccessKeyId": "ASIAZZ7ZZZZZZZZDFASDFASDFADF"
    }
}
```

This will output a JSON string. You will need to copy the values inside the JSON
string into environment variables, using something like the following:
```bash
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={AccessKeyIdFromResponse}
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SecretAccessKeyFromResponse}
$ export AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN={SessionTokenFromResponse}
```

Note: Hopefully at some point, someone will turn this into some kind of script
to make it easier, for now, you just have to do some manual commands and
copy-paste efforts.

#### Private Key
You will need to make sure you have the private key, or create a public/private
key placed into the `~/.ssh/` folder inside the guest VM in order for SSH to
function into your VM. Further instructions will be added for this soon.

#### Spin up the EC2 Server

Once you're done, you can now provision your EC2 instance, by running a similar
command to the following inside the Guest VM:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook /vagrant/ansible/playbooks/provision-ec2.yml --inventory-file=/vagrant/ansible/inventory/ec2
```

### Installing Software
To install software, or to run any of the playbooks provided by the
dev-environment, or its submodules, you'll use the `ansible-playbook` command.

For example to run the setup playbook against the vagrant environment itself:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook /vagrant/ansible/playbooks/setup.yml --inventory-file=/vagrant/ansible/inventory/local_hosts --connection=local
```

It's much easier to type all that if you go into the directory where the
playbook you're trying to run lives.
```bash
$ cd \vagrant\ansible\playbooks
$ ansible-playbook setup.yml --inventory=../inventory/local_hosts --connection=local
```
